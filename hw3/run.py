	'''The function to run your ML algorithm on given datasets, generate the predictions and save them into the provided file path
	
	Parameters
	----------
	Xtrain_file: string
		the path to Xtrain csv file
	Ytrain_file: string
		the path to Ytrain csv file
	test_data_file: string
		the path to test data csv file
	pred_file: string
		the prediction file to be saved by your code. You have to save your predictions into this file path following the same format of Ytrain_file
